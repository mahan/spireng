# spireng

Spireng is a (yet another and very simple) HTML5/Canvas 2D engine.

Features (very basic):

    * Drawing
    * Sprites (with rotation)
    * Sprite animations (based on sprite sheets)
    * Resource loader

It forms the basis of other pet-project of mine, not yet published.

For the time being I'd not recommend anyone else to write anything against it as it's extremely immature and the API is very likely to change.

It might however be of some interest for HTML5/Canvas beginners that want ideas on where to start and quickly get some stuff up and running in the browser.
